# Create Machine Definitions

## Startup

See main documentation.

## YML file structure

By default, a FabSim3 install will contain 3 machine-specific YML files:
- machines.yml, which shows default values for machine-specific variables for each machine.
- machines_user.yml, which shows user-specific values for machine-specific variables for each machine. This may include the name of the user account. This file is *not* committed to the repository.
- machines_user_example.yml, a basic example of machines_user.yml
