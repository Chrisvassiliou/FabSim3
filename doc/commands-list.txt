FabMD:
    do_ibi                Copy the obtained output to a work directory, do an IBI (Iterative Boltzmann Inversion) iteration and make a new config file from the resulting data.
    do_pmf                Copy the obtained output to a work directory, do an PMF (Potential Mean Force) iteration and make a new config file from the resulting data.
    full_ibi              Performs both do_ibi and runs lammps with the newly created config file.
    full_ibi_multi        Do multiple IBI iterations in one command.
    full_pmf              Performs both do_pmf and runs lammps with the newly created config file.
    full_pmf_multi        Do multiple PMF iterations in one command.
    ibi_analysis_multi    Recreate IBI analysis results based on the output files provided.
    lammps                Submit a LAMMPS job to the remote queue.

FabBioMD
    namd                  Submit a NAMD job to the remote queue.
    find_namd_executable
    dir_structure         Creates appropriate directory structure for standard ensemble simulations from the initial directory structure created by BAC builder.
    bac_namd_archerlike   Submit an ensemble NAMD equilibration/simulation job to ARCHER.
    bac_namd_hartreelike  Submit an ensemble NAMD equilibration/simulation job to BlueWonder.
    bac_nmode_archerlike  Submit an ensemble MMPBSA/NMODE calculation job to ARCHER.
    bac_nmode_hartreelike Submit an ensemble MMPBSA/NMODE calculation job to BlueWonder.
    bac_nm_remote_archerlike  Submit an ensemble MMPBSA/NMODE calculation job to ARCHER when simulation trajectories are already located at the remote machine.
    bac_nm_remote_hartreelike Submit an ensemble MMPBSA/NMODE calculation job to BlueWonder when simulation trajectories are already located at the remote machine.
