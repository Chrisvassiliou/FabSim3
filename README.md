FabSim
======

FabSim is a Fabric-based automation toolkit for Scientific Simulations. It is under development, and therefore not yet fully supported.

Earlier derivative versions of FabSim include:
* FabHemeLB (previously known as /FabricHemeLB/), which is used to automate workflows involving 
the HemeLB lattice-Boltzmann simulation environment (see http://www.github.com/UCL/hemelb for 
the source code of that).
* FabMD, which is used to semi-automatically coarse-grain polymer systems.

The aim for our work on FabSim is to create a generalized version of these two toolkits, 
and for this toolkit to be aplied to other applications as well.

## Installation and usage 

For instructions on how to install and test FabSim, please refer to `INSTALL.md`.
